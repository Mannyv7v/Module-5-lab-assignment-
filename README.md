This assignment was a list of 5 task that we needed to create a program for using python

Task one: We were instructed to make a program that prints "Hello, World!" 100 times.

Task two: We were instructed to create two programs, one that prints a list of numbers one right after another, and one that prints the same list, and its square right after it. 

Task 3: We were instructed to create a code that draws a polygon based on user input. 
I attempted to research on how to do this. However, I dont think i managed to make it work. 

Task 4: We were instructed to print a list of numbers of 1-50. we would also print a message if the number printed was divisable by 3,5 or both. 

Task 5: We were intructed to play around with the turtle function and draw something. Me bing very uncreative here, i simply coded my turtle to draw a pentagon.
